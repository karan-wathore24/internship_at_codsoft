            <h2>Early life </h2>
            <p>Sharma was born on 30 April 1987 into a Telugu-Marathi speaking family in Bansod, 
                Nagpur, Maharashtra, India. His mother, Purnima Sharma, is from Visakhapatnam, 
                Andhra Pradesh. His father, Gurunath Sharma, worked as a caretaker of a transport firm 
                storehouse. Sharma was raised by his grandparents and uncles in Borivali because of his father's
                 low income. He would visit his parents, who lived in a single-room house in Dombivli, 
                 only during weekends. He has a younger brother, Vishal Sharma.

                Sharma joined a cricket camp in 1999 with his uncle's money.
                 Dinesh Lad, his coach at the camp, asked him to change his school 
                 to Swami Vivekanand International School, where Lad was the coach and the 
                 cricket facilities were better than those at Sharma's old school. Sharma recollects, 
                 "I told him I couldn't afford it, but he got me a scholarship. So for four years I didn't
                  pay a penny, and did well in my cricket". Sharma started as an off-spinner who could bat
                   a bit before Lad noticed his batting ability and promoted him from number eight to open the
                    innings. He excelled in the Harris and Giles Shield school cricket tournaments, scoring a 
                    century on debut as an opener.</p>

        <h2>Personal Life </h2>
        <p>Sharma married his longtime girlfriend, Ritika Sajdeh on 13 December 2015 whom he first met in 2008.
             They have one child, a girl born on 30 December 2018 named Samaira.
              Sharma is a practitioner of the meditation technique Sahaj Marg.
             He practices an eggetarian diet.</p>

        <h2>Test Matches </h2>
        <p>In November 2013, during Sachin Tendulkar's farewell series, Sharma made his 
            Test debut at Eden Gardens in Kolkata against West Indies and scored 177, the 
            second-highest score on debut by an Indian to Shikhar Dhawan (187). He 
            followed it up with 111 (not out) in the second Test at his home ground, the
             Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai.

            Having been out of the Test team since 2017–18, Sharma went on the 2018–19 tour 
            of Australia after he had earned a recall earlier. Chief selector M. S. K. Prasad 
            said the reason for his recall was that his natural game suited the bouncy Australian
             pitches.Sharma played in the first Test in Adelaide, scoring 37 and 1 in an Indian 
             victory. During the first Test, he sustained a minor injury which saw him miss 
             the second Test in Perth. He recovered for the Boxing Day third Test at Melbourne and 
             scored 63 (not out) to help India total 443/7 and win both the Test and the series.
             After the third Test, Sharma had to return to India for the birth of his daughter.
            
            In October 2019, in the third Test against South Africa, Sharma scored his 2,000th run and 
            his first double century in Tests. He made 212 in the first innings of the match.
            Sharma was named as vice-captain of India's Test team during the tour of Australia in 2020,
             replacing Cheteshwar Pujara.
            
            Sharma had a successful home series against England in 2021. Instrumental in his team's 
            comeback after a defeat in the first Test at Chennai, he scored a century, one that The 
            Guardian termed "deserves to be considered one of the greatest this century." He put 
            
            on 167 runs with Ajinkya Rahane for the fourth wicket while making 161 runs in an innings 
            that included 18 fours and two sixes. India went on to win the Test by 317 runs.
             He top-scored for his side in both innings of the low-scoring third Test in Ahmedabad
              with scores of 66 and 25 contributing to his team's win. Sharma finished the series
              
              aggregating 345 runs, the most for India, at an average of 58. He went on to score his 
              
              first overseas Test century on 4 September 2021 with an innings of 127 against England at The Oval,
               also reaching the milestone of 3,000 runs in Test cricket.
            
            Sharma was appointed captain of India's Test team in February 2022,
             succeeding Virat Kohli, ahead of a two-match series against Sri Lanka. Sunil Gavaskar
              praised his leadership and Chetan Sharma, India's chairman of selectors, 
              said: "We will groom future captains under him".</p>

    <h2>One Day Matches </h2>
    <p>Sharma made his full international debut in a one-day match against Ireland in Belfast on
         23 June 2007. This was part of the 2007 Future Cup competition which also involved South
          Africa. He was number seven in the batting order but did not bat as India won the game by 9 wickets.

        He scored his maiden ODI half-century (52) against Pakistan at Jaipur on 18 November 2007 and was
         selected for the Indian squad going to the 2007–08 Commonwealth Bank Series in Australia.
         In that series, he scored 235 runs at an average of 33.57 with 2 fifties, including 66 in the first 
         final at Sydney when he partnered Sachin Tendulkar for most of India's successful run chase.
          After that, however, his ODI performances suffered a downturn and he lost his middle-order position
           to Suresh Raina. Later, Virat Kohli took his position as the reserve batsman. In December 2009, 
           following his triple century in the Ranji Trophy, he was recalled to the ODI team for the tri-nations 
           tournament in Bangladesh as Tendulkar opted to rest in the series.
        
        He scored his maiden ODI century (114) against Zimbabwe on 28 May 2010 and followed it up with 
        another century in the next match of the tri-series against Sri Lanka on 30 May 2010 by scoring
         101 not out.[66][67] He had a run of poor form in South Africa just before the 2011 World Cup and
          as a consequence he was left out of India's squad for the tournament.
        
        Sharma was recalled to the limited-overs squad for the tour of the West Indies in June and July 2011.
         In the first match at Queen's Park Oval, he scored 68 (not out) from 75 balls with three fours and a six.
          In the third match at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua, he scored a match-winning 86 off 91
           balls after India had been reduced to 92 for 6.
        
        He had a disastrous loss of form in 2012 and scored only 168 runs in the whole calendar year at the very
         low average of 12.92 with just a single half-century. Even so, his captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni showed
          faith in him, and his career was revived in 2013. Dhoni decided to move him up the batting order to open
           the innings with Shikhar Dhawan in the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy. The pairing was a success and India 
           won the competition, defeating hosts England in the final.
        
        His good form continued and, later in the year against Australia, he scored 141 (not out) in Jaipur.
         He followed that with 209 off 158 balls in Bangalore and established a then-world record for the most 
         sixes (16) in a one-day international innings (since beaten by Eoin Morgan of England with 17).
          On 13 November 2014, playing against Sri Lanka at Eden Gardens in Kolkata, Sharma broke the world
           record for the highest score in a one-day international innings with 264 from 173 deliveries.
        
        In December 2017, India's captain Virat Kohli was rested for the series against Sri Lanka, in preparation
         for India's tour to South Africa, which began in the first week of January 2018. In his place, Sharma was 
         appointed team captain and India under his leadership won the series 2–1, their eighth consecutive series 
         win since defeating Zimbabwe in June 2016.[75][76] Sharma also hit his third ODI double-century in this 
         series, scoring 208 (not out) to extend his record of most ODI double-centuries by a player.
        
        In September 2018, in the absence of many top players including regular captain Virat Kohli, Sharma 
        led India to win the 2018 Asia Cup, where they defeated Bangladesh in the final.
        
        On 12 January 2019, in the opening match against Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground,
         Sharma scored 133 but it was in vain as India lost by 34 runs. It was his 22nd century in one-day
          internationals.[79] At Delhi on 13 March 2019, in the fifth and final match of a home series against
           Australia, Sharma scored 56 including his 8,000th run in one-day internationals. It was his 200th
            innings.[80] In 2019, he scored the most runs in ODIs by any batsman, with 1,490 runs in the calendar
             year, including 7 centuries.
        
        In November 2020, Sharma was nominated for the ICC Men's ODI Cricketer of the Decade award.
        
        In July 2022, Sharma became the first Indian captain to lead their team to both T20I and ODI series 
        wins in England. He became the 3rd Indian captain to win an ODI series in England, and the first since 
        2014.</p>

    <h2>T-20 Matches </h2>
    <p>Sharma was included in the Indian squad for the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 and made his mark by scoring
         an unbeaten 50 from 40 deliveries against hosts South Africa in a must win Super Eight match. 
         This enabled India to win the match by 37 runs and they went on to defeat Pakistan in the final, 
         when Sharma scored 30 (not out) from 16 deliveries.
<br>
        On 2 October 2015, during the South African tour of India, Sharma scored 106 in the first Twenty20
         international at HPCA Stadium in Dharamshala. With that, he became the second Indian cricketer to
          have scored centuries in all three formats of international cricket.
        <br>
        In December 2017, in a series against Sri Lanka, Sharma scored the joint-fastest T20I century,
         in 35 balls, ending with 118 from 43 deliveries, equaling the record of David Miller. This was 
         also his second century in Twenty20 internationals.
        <br>
        On 8 July 2018, during a series in England, Sharma became the second Indian batsman, after Virat Kohli,
         to score 2,000 runs in a Twenty20 international career.[89] He was the fifth batsman worldwide to achieve
          the feat; the others besides Kohli were Brendon McCullum, Martin Guptill and Shoaib Malik.
           He also scored his third T20I century during this series, equaling the then-record for most T20I 
           centuries, held by Colin Munro.
        <br>
        In March 2018, he led Team India to win the Nidahas Trophy under his captaincy.In November 2018, in a
         series against West Indies, he scored his fourth T20I century, creating a new record for the most 
         centuries by a player in T20I cricket.
        <br>
        In November 2019, in the opening match of the series against Bangladesh, Sharma became the most-capped 
        cricketer for India in T20Is, playing in his 99th match. In the next match of the series, he became 
        the first male cricketer for India to play in 100 T20Is.
        <br>
        In November 2020, Sharma was nominated for the ICC Men's T20I Cricketer of the Decade award.
        <br>
        In July 2022, Sharma became the first captain in T20I history to lead their team to 14 consecutive 
        victories.
        <br>
        With his participation in the 2022 T20 World Cup in Australia, Sharma became the only Indian cricketer 
        to have played in every edition of the tournament since its inception in 2007.
        <br>
        On 27 October 2022, Sharma broke the record for most sixes by an Indian batsman in T20 World Cups,
         previously held by Yuvraj Singh, hitting his 34th six against Netherlands at Sydney Cricket Ground.
         
        <br>
        In May 2024, he was named as a captain in India’s squad for the 2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup tournament.
         In June 2024, during a match against Ireland, Rohit Sharma achieved the milestone of hitting 600 sixes 
         in international cricket across all formats. On 29 June 2024, Sharma led India to win the 2024 T-20
         
         
         World cup after defeating South Africa in the finals.[100] In the post-match press conference after the
          T20 World Cup victory, Sharma declared his retirement from T20s, while confirming that he would continue 
          to represent India in ODIs and Test match formats.</p>
